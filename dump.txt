17/05/2015, 21:58 - Neha Design: thats not swag for sure
17/05/2015, 22:04 - Shubham Luhadia: Fa se phantom! This is Bombay velvet time!
17/05/2015, 22:05 - Shubham Luhadia: 😂 Sorry, but not swag!!
17/05/2015, 22:06 - Neha Design: kaisi thhi?
17/05/2015, 22:06 - Shubham Luhadia: Achhi thi! 😄
17/05/2015, 22:07 - Shubham Luhadia: Really liked the beautiful works that he creates! But, karan johar for sure does not seen menacing at all! I expected him to break into "welcome to koffee with karan" at any moment!
17/05/2015, 22:07 - Neha Design: happy or sad ending
17/05/2015, 22:07 - Shubham Luhadia: *world
17/05/2015, 22:07 - Shubham Luhadia: Really neha? Really?
17/05/2015, 22:08 - Neha Design: i dont watch sad ending movies
17/05/2015, 22:08 - Neha Design: try to avoid atleast
17/05/2015, 22:08 - Shubham Luhadia: None whatsoever?
17/05/2015, 22:08 - Neha Design: 😳😁
17/05/2015, 22:48 - Kanishk: Lol neha
17/05/2015, 22:48 - Neha Design: wats lol in that
17/05/2015, 22:49 - Kanishk: Sadness me hi zindagi ke asli rang hote hai ☺
17/05/2015, 22:53 - Neha Design: doesnt mean everyone wants to pay n bear 3 hrs of it
17/05/2015, 22:53 - Kanishk: Maaf kr do bolne ke liye
17/05/2015, 22:54 - Neha Design: 😛😝
17/05/2015, 23:04 - Shubham Luhadia: Have you heard of something called catharsis? Why did Greeks have it then? Why do sad endings become epic all the way from Romeo and Juliet to Jai in Sholay ? From Hamlet to Mother India? From Aashiqui 2 to HIMYM?
17/05/2015, 23:04 - Shubham Luhadia: And I can go on further!?
17/05/2015, 23:05 - Shubham Luhadia: Neha that is a very bleak way to avoid vulnerability. Like an ostrich: stick your head in sand and assume that you can't see the enemy(here sadness) means the enemy can't see you!
17/05/2015, 23:06 - Neha Design: jai ho...
17/05/2015, 23:06 - Kanishk: Go on ....
17/05/2015, 23:07 - Kanishk: Wah ji wah kya kaha hai shubham bhai
17/05/2015, 23:07 - Shubham Luhadia: I think I might be boring the people with my sermon...
17/05/2015, 23:07 - Kanishk: Na ji na
17/05/2015, 23:09 - Neha Design: aftr watching a movie i wanna be happy abt it... n about avoiding vurnebility judging people becoz they just avoid movies wid sad endings.. isnt a good way to go I guess
17/05/2015, 23:10 - Neha Design: btw himym had a good ending
17/05/2015, 23:10 - Neha Design: 😌
17/05/2015, 23:11 - Neha Design: waise bhi I cry.. at so many small stuff i dont want to pay 300 bucks for that
17/05/2015, 23:11 - Shubham Luhadia: Yeah. Everything is about judging people isn't it. Day one word you don't like and you judge people. Why can't you be happy feeling sad? Is that either/or kind of a thing? You actually feel cleansed when you feel sad for someone you are no way connected to: a distant character.. And that is not me and my idea, Socrates!
17/05/2015, 23:11 - Neha Design: shubham zyada lamba mat likh.. padha nahi jayega
17/05/2015, 23:12 - Shubham Luhadia: A good thing: films are way cheap in hyd. Normally Rs. 50. Aaj ranbir tha so rs. 60.
17/05/2015, 23:12 - Shubham Luhadia: So being sad at this process is fine?
17/05/2015, 23:13 - Neha Design: yeah thats socrates idea i may feel cleansed with a totally different idea
17/05/2015, 23:13 - Shubham Luhadia: See: for himym, you felt sad when she dies but happy about robin and the hero(forgot his name). So it's not either/or
17/05/2015, 23:14 - Neha Design: just called taste
17/05/2015, 23:14 - Neha Design: i dont like horror movies too... any comments on that
17/05/2015, 23:14 - Shubham Luhadia: So what gives you that cleansing feeling?
17/05/2015, 23:14 - Shubham Luhadia: See: horror is a genre. Sad ending is not!
17/05/2015, 23:15 - Neha Design: u r not my counsellor....n this isnt a therapy session
17/05/2015, 23:15 - Neha Design: its not i m emotionally shut down.. so i guess its fine
17/05/2015, 23:15 - Shubham Luhadia: You might love the characters, adore the movie, like the direction, shake with the music, worship the actors, but still not watch the movie because it had a sad ending??
17/05/2015, 23:16 - Neha Design: no i dont... i try to avoid always thats my thing 😌😝
17/05/2015, 23:16 - Shubham Luhadia: No body calls you emotionally shut down?!! 😂😂😂😂
On the exact opposite! I am calling you too much afraid of your own sentimentality!
17/05/2015, 23:18 - Shubham Luhadia: Chalo. Enough drama for today. Let's save some for tomorrow?😉
17/05/2015, 23:18 - Neha Design: as u wish

23/05/2015, 11:22 - Vishal Keshav: If you dont have that feature at one place, you will surely go to some 'alternative'. And how file uploading in hike in a group is different from pasting a dropbox link? Budhdhu!
23/05/2015, 11:22 - Shubham Luhadia: Because, Dropbox keeps track of changes.
23/05/2015, 11:23 - Shubham Luhadia: I might want to revert back!
23/05/2015, 11:23 - Vishal Keshav: And who said hike dont do that for an uploaded file?

Ishant, Jains have monks called Muni Majaraj. For Shwetambaras, like Doshi above, after Deeksha (ceremony of taking up monkhood) they wear just white clothes and for Digambaras, muni maharajas wear no clothes. Then they join the group of some famous Muni and roam (vihaar) across the country, on foot, to various Jain cities, meeting people, visiting temples, giving lectures (pravachan), doing social work etc.
02/06/2015, 14:22 - Ishant Wankhede: Romantics

VERY IMPORTANT: ☝
Max Temperatures recorded in some Indian cities:

☀Lucknow 47 degrees
☀Delhi 47 degrees
☀Agra 45 degrees
☀Nagpur 46 degrees
☀Kota 48 degrees
☀Hyderabad 45 degrees
☀Pune 42 degrees
☀Ahmedabad 46 degrees

Next years these cities will cross 50 degrees. Even AC or fan will not save you in summer.. 😰

Why is it so hot ?????
☀☀☀☀☀☀☀☀☀☀
In last 10 years over 10 crore trees were cut for widening roads and highways. 
🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳But not more than a lakh trees has been planted by govt. or public.

How to make India cool ?????
☔☔☔☔☔☔☔☔☔☔

Please do not wait for government to plant trees. 

Sowing seeds or planting trees does not cost much.
🌳🌲🌴🌿🍂🍃🌳🌴🌲🌳
Just collect seeds of fruits like Mango, Lemon, Jamun, Neem, Custard Apple, Jack fruit, etc.
🍎🍏🍊🍋🍒🍇🍐🍍🍈🍑
Then dig two-three inch hole on open spaces, roadside, footpaths, highways, gardens and also in your society or bungalow. 

Bury these seeds in each hole with soil and then water them every two days in summer.
🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿🚿
In rainy season no need to water them. 

After 15 to 30 days small plants will be born.  
🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱
Please nurture them and ensure they grow big.

Let us make this a National movement and plant 10 crore trees all over India.
🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳
We should stop temperature from crossing 50 degrees.....
⏬🆒🆗⏬🆒🆗⏬🆒🆗⏬
Please plant maximum trees and forward this message to everyone. Lets distribute saplings as return gifts during functions, birthdays etc.

18/06/2015, 22:10 - Pranshu: A very simple but confusing puzzle.
A lady buys goods worth rs.200 from a shop. (shopkeeper selling the goods with zero profit).
The lady gives him 1000 rs note. The shopkeeper gets the change from the next shop and keeps 200 for himself and returns rs.800 to d lady.
Later the shopkeeper of the next shop comes with the 1000rs note saying "duplicate" and takes his money back.
How much loss did the first shopkeeper face?
18/06/2015, 22:15 - Ishant Wankhede: 1000
18/06/2015, 22:16 - Pranshu: Please all answers with explanation

It would have been nice that if you were so worried you dropped a call ! I think i talk on the fone.. Romel knows that..and yes i may not have replied to whats happening or kya kar raha..cuz simply put mere pas jawab nai hai in sawalon ke. I stay at home  play and read books. Pretty boring stuff this ..abt which I doubt anyone would want to know. And yes what i do online then ? Well most of the time I have been busy bombarding my dilemmas on people ..regarding my job which I am confused about .Any of this if has been taken as my ignoring then I am sorry . I am still and will strive to make sure that all the people I have valued all these years stay forever. 😘

Romel and neha asked me to drop them to subhu. Near kapili thry told that they would be accompanying me to the airport. I enquired why didn't they say so near Dihing so that others could have joined to which they replied that everyone knew and finally they only decided to come.
On our way to airport, neha told me that she lied about others knowing that they were coming and Romel explained that they had decided that before that they would be joining me, and that he didn't know why neha said that.
25/06/2015, 23:47 - Pranshu: I too wasn't expecting and even if I had then that was a gesture by a group, not 2 individuals.

09/10/2015, 17:37 - Vishal Keshav: 🌅🔆 सुनने की आदत डालो क्योंकि
ताने मारने वालों की कमी नहीं हैं।
मुस्कराने की आदत डालो क्योंकि
रुलाने वालों की कमी नहीं हैं
ऊपर उठने की आदतडालो क्योंकि
टांग खींचने वालों की कमी नहीं है।
प्रोत्साहित करने की आदत डालो क्योंकि
हतोत्साहित करने वालों की कमी नहीं है🌳🌅

🌳छोटी सी मगर बेहद खूबसूरत लाईन: 🌅

जो प्राप्त है,
वो पर्याप्त है 

गंदगी तो पैसे वालो ने फैलाई है..
वरना गरीब तो सङको से थैलियाँ
तक उठा लेते है...!!🌅

🌳 "अहंकार" दिखाके किसी रिश्ते को तोड़ने से अच्छा है की.....

 "माफ़ी" मांगकर वो रिश्ता  निभाया जाये।🌳🌅

 🌅🌳☝एक सच्चाई--

खाली बोतल ले जाने वालो ने
बंगले बना लिए , 

और बोतल खाली करने
वालो ने जमीनें बेच दीं....।
😜😁🌳🌅

🌳जो हमेशा कहे ..
मेरे पास समय नहीं...
असल में वह 'व्यस्त' नहीं,
बल्कि 'अस्त-व्यस्त' है..

🌅🌳।।स्वामी विवेकानंद।।🌳🌅

🌳सच्चा व्यक्ति ना तो नास्तिक होता है ना ही आस्तिक होता है ।
सच्चा व्यक्ति हर समय वास्तविक होता है🌅

🌳मौन और मुस्कान
दो शक्तिशाली हथियार होते है
मुस्कान से कई समस्याओ को
हल किया जा सकता है और
मौन रहकर कई समस्याओ को दूर रखा जा सकता है।

24/10/2015, 10:43 - Ishant Wankhede: Faster optimization | MIT News - http://news.mit.edu/2015/faster-optimization-algorithm-1023
24/10/2015, 10:43 - Ishant Wankhede: New algo for solving optimization algorithms coming up, its called the cutting plane method how cool is that.
24/10/2015, 11:31 - Vishal Keshav: Nice, this uses gradient decent approach to find the slope, hence line to remove impossible solution set. But I think, this will work if the cost function has a global maxima/minima at every step.
24/10/2015, 11:33 - Ishant Wankhede: Even I felt so, but I don't have the proper theory behind gd.
24/10/2015, 11:36 - Vishal Keshav: At every point (chosen randomly), we try to go in a direction having max/min slope, pretending our solution lies there.  But the path length we travel is small. This slope finding is done at every step, till our solution starts converging.
24/10/2015, 11:37 - Ishant Wankhede: 😅

01/11/2015, 23:55 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Try it seriously dont cheat its amazing
A MUST TRY!!!!!!!          ALZHEIMERS'  EYE TEST

(I love this part.. It's absolutely amazing!)   

Count every  "  F  " in the following text:

FINISHED  FILES ARE THE RE
SULT OF YEARS OF SCIENTI
FIC STUDY COMBINED  WITH
THE EXPERIENCE OF YEARS...  
(SEE  BELOW)


HOW MANY ? 
  
3....4....






WRONG,  THERE ARE  6  --  no joke.
READ IT AGAIN !
Really, go Back and Try to find the  6 F's before you scroll down.


The reasoning behind is  further down.





The brain cannot  process "OF".

Incredible  or what? Go back and look again!!

Anyone who counts  all 6 "F's" on the first go is a genius.

Three  is normal, four is quite rare. 

Send this to your  friends. 
It will drive them crazy!!:

Good isnt it.. 
👍👍👍

12/11/2015, 23:08 - Vishal Keshav: So I guessed it right
12/11/2015, 23:08 - Shubham Luhadia: Yeah... It's older than rakhi though... And not as secular, only Hindus. (And religions derived from Hinduism)

12/11/2015, 23:12 - Vishal Keshav: Fir red color ka tika laga kar laddoo khilana, jaise bhagwaan ko chafhate hain
12/11/2015, 23:12 - Shubham Luhadia: My older cousins send me gifts with rakhi.
12/11/2015, 23:13 - Shubham Luhadia: Behen ki "worship" happens every time they leave maayka for sasural.

12/11/2015, 23:27 - Vishal Keshav: You are just reducing the bounds
12/11/2015, 23:28 - Vishal Keshav: Further reduction 50-50
12/11/2015, 23:28 - Shubham Luhadia: I don't want to. But Romel insists it is more comfortable.
12/11/2015, 23:28 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Good by me..

14/11/2015, 01:29 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: 👍🏻👍🏻
14/11/2015, 01:44 - Shubham Luhadia: Really? It was boring. Plus you don't even get the GoT references!
14/11/2015, 02:05 - Shubham Luhadia: Hey, people! About the January trip. I feel that north would be too cold. And if we do go to gurgaon, how will you people arrange for blankets etc? Kolkata seems a better choice.
14/11/2015, 02:06 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Goa ka kya hua?
14/11/2015, 02:07 - Shubham Luhadia: Well, other than that.
14/11/2015, 02:07 - Shubham Luhadia: If we are fixed on goa, why not book tickets now???
14/11/2015, 02:07 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Let's
14/11/2015, 02:08 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: I have one more suggestions...  Daman
14/11/2015, 02:10 - Shubham Luhadia: Daman, I have been there. Not that great. The beach sucks. All rocky for kilometers.
14/11/2015, 02:10 - Shubham Luhadia: Diu is a little better... But still, nothing when compared to goa.
14/11/2015, 02:11 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 All hail to Goa 🙏🙏🙏🙏
14/11/2015, 02:11 - Shubham Luhadia: 😊
14/11/2015, 02:12 - Shubham Luhadia: Hyd and bang people can go by bus.
14/11/2015, 02:12 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Bombay to Goa style 😄😄
14/11/2015, 02:12 - Shubham Luhadia: 😂

14/11/2015, 02:12 - Ishant Wankhede: Delhi waalon ka socho
14/11/2015, 02:13 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Bus se 2 din..
14/11/2015, 02:14 - Shubham Luhadia: It's costly!!!
14/11/2015, 02:14 - Shubham Luhadia: For them.
14/11/2015, 02:15 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Let's divide the cost...
14/11/2015, 02:15 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: It's not fair to tell some people to come...
14/11/2015, 02:15 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: If others aren't ready..
14/11/2015, 02:15 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: To do the same..
14/11/2015, 02:17 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Detour funny video: https://m.facebook.com/ehbeefamily/videos/1020461818028572/
14/11/2015, 02:23 - Ishant Wankhede: Bahut costly 😅
14/11/2015, 02:24 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: For single people..
14/11/2015, 02:24 - Shubham Luhadia: What do you mean??
14/11/2015, 02:24 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Not if shared..
14/11/2015, 02:24 - Shubham Luhadia: Hmm...
14/11/2015, 02:25 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Vo video dekho...  Mast hain..
14/11/2015, 02:25 - Shubham Luhadia: Saw that. It is staged. Still funny...
14/11/2015, 02:27 - Shubham Luhadia: Can I be the devil's advocate: if we are sharing, someone (take me) might think, I'll also go by flight, why should I come early from office, sit in a cramped bus for 9 hours when I can also reach within an hour? Then, of everybody thinks that, the average becomes costly too.
14/11/2015, 02:28 - Shubham Luhadia: No advantage in your plan unless, 
1. The place is closer to one or more people
Or 2. If people are happily ready to be as austerity conscious as possible!
14/11/2015, 02:29 - Shubham Luhadia: Even at the cost of significant personal discomfort.
14/11/2015, 02:29 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: It's the tragedy of commons over and over...
14/11/2015, 02:29 - Shubham Luhadia: True that.
14/11/2015, 02:30 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: You got the answer..
14/11/2015, 02:30 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: It works of everyone thinks of common welfare..  Not otherwise..
14/11/2015, 02:30 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: *if
14/11/2015, 02:31 - Shubham Luhadia: But then, it builds resentment. We not a joint family who stay together even when people might resent each other.
14/11/2015, 02:32 - Shubham Luhadia: I would hate for that to happen!
14/11/2015, 02:32 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Resentment will be more in other case...
14/11/2015, 02:32 - Ishant Wankhede: Joint family 🚬
14/11/2015, 02:33 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: 😂😂😂
14/11/2015, 02:33 - Shubham Luhadia: If we pick a place closer to one or few people, then everybody knows that their chance will come to, when they get to spend less.
14/11/2015, 02:33 - Shubham Luhadia: So, like karma, no resentment.
14/11/2015, 02:33 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: People don't stay close... Over long period of tym..
14/11/2015, 02:33 - Shubham Luhadia: Sorry??
14/11/2015, 02:34 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: That period might not come,  hate to say this..
14/11/2015, 02:34 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Well all be busy in couples of months..
14/11/2015, 02:34 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Devil's advocate #2
14/11/2015, 02:35 - Shubham Luhadia: 😅
14/11/2015, 02:35 - Shubham Luhadia: I think for a couple of years...
14/11/2015, 02:35 - Shubham Luhadia: Till we complete all the 4 places.
14/11/2015, 02:35 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Cycle is long...  In your way..
14/11/2015, 02:35 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: In my alternative,  it's short..
14/11/2015, 02:36 - Shubham Luhadia: In my case, everybody would vie to be the perfect host! 😂
14/11/2015, 02:36 - Shubham Luhadia: Mere ghar is baar! Nahin nahin, mere ghar!
14/11/2015, 02:36 - Shubham Luhadia: See, it will bring us closer.
14/11/2015, 02:37 - Shubham Luhadia: 😁
14/11/2015, 02:37 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Nah.. Not really..
14/11/2015, 02:37 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: People want to chill...  At this point of tym..
14/11/2015, 02:37 - Shubham Luhadia: You mean, we won't meet at all.
14/11/2015, 02:37 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: When did I say that..
14/11/2015, 02:37 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Chill in good places..
14/11/2015, 02:37 - Shubham Luhadia: What did you mean then?
14/11/2015, 02:37 - Shubham Luhadia: Ohh...
14/11/2015, 02:37 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Not tera ghar mera ghar
14/11/2015, 02:38 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Like Goa..
14/11/2015, 02:38 - Shubham Luhadia: Hmm...
14/11/2015, 02:38 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Araku valley night is boring..
14/11/2015, 02:38 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Sirf ek tribal show type hi hota hain..
14/11/2015, 02:39 - Shubham Luhadia: See, Jaipur is closer to gurgaon.  They spent a lot last time. So, we could go there this time. Goa, since it's costly, let's keep for some other time.
14/11/2015, 02:39 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Why not go to some mountain?
14/11/2015, 02:39 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: UK
14/11/2015, 02:40 - Shubham Luhadia: Ohh, uttarakhand.
14/11/2015, 02:40 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: I prefer mountain..
14/11/2015, 02:40 - Shubham Luhadia: 😂
14/11/2015, 02:40 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: 😂😂
14/11/2015, 02:40 - Shubham Luhadia: We could.
14/11/2015, 02:41 - Shubham Luhadia: Let's see all options. Each one of us take one of them, do a full cost analysis. Then whichever is cheaper, let's head there.
14/11/2015, 02:41 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Constrained optimization..
14/11/2015, 02:41 - Ishant Wankhede: 😊
14/11/2015, 02:42 - Ishant Wankhede: Good going guys.
14/11/2015, 02:42 - Shubham Luhadia: 😁

13/12/2015, 15:55 - Shubham Luhadia: Or let's go for reinforcement learning. It would take care, if in case, something changes drastically. Like I start watching naruto, and so I also need those messages!

Remember that stuff about hiding under a table or standing in a doorway? Well, forget it! This is a real eye opener. It could save your life someday.

EXTRACT FROM DOUG COPP'S ARTICLE ON 'THE TRIANGLE OF LIFE'

My name is Doug Copp. I am the Rescue Chief and Disaster Manager of the American Rescue Team International (ARTI ), the world's most experienced rescue team. The information in this article will save lives in an earthquake.

I have crawled inside 875 collapsed buildings, worked with rescue teams from 60 countries, founded rescue teams in several countries, and I am a member of many rescue teams from many countries. I was the United Nations expert in Disaster Mitigation for two years, and have worked at every major disaster in the world since 1985, except for simultaneous disasters.

The first building I ever crawled inside of was a school in Mexico City during the 1985 earthquake. Every child was under its desk. Every child was crushed to the thickness of their bones. They could have survived by lying down next to their desks in the aisles. It was obscene -- unnecessary.

Simply stated, when buildings collapse, the weight of the ceilings falling upon the objects or furniture inside crushes these objects, leaving a space or void next to them - NOT under them. This space is what I call the 'triangle of life'. The larger the object, the stronger, the less it will compact. The less the object compacts, the larger the void, the greater the probability that the person who is using this void for safety will not be injured. The next time you watch collapsed buildings, on television, count the 'triangles' you see formed. They are everywhere. It is the most common shape, you will see, in a collapsed building. 

TIPS FOR EARTHQUAKE SAFETY

1) Most everyone who simply 'ducks and covers' when building collapse are crushed to death. People who get under objects, like desks or cars, are crushed.

2) Cats, dogs and babies often naturally curl up in the fetal position. You should too in an earthquake. It is a natural safety/survival instinct. You can survive in a smaller void. Get next to an object, next to a sofa, next to a bed, next to a large bulky object that will compress slightly but leave a void next to it.

3) Wooden buildings are the safest type of construction to be in during an earthquake. Wood is flexible and moves with the force of theearthquake. If the wooden building does collapse, large survival voids are created. Also, the wooden building has less concentrated, crushing weight. Brick buildings will break into individual bricks. Bricks will cause many injuries but less squashed bodies than concrete slabs.

4) If you are in bed during the night and an earthquake occurs, simply roll off the bed. A safe void will exist around the bed. Hotels can achieve a much greater survival rate in earthquakes, simply by posting a sign on the back of the door of every room telling occupants to lie down on the floor, next to the bottom of the bed during an earthquake.

5) If an earthquake happens and you cannot easily escape by getting out the door or window, then lie down and curl up in the fetal position next to a sofa, or large chair.

6) Most everyone who gets under a doorway when buildings collapse is killed. How? If you stand under a doorway and the doorjamb falls forward or backward you will be crushed by the ceiling above. If the door jam falls sideways you will be cut in half by the doorway. In either case, you will be killed!

7) Never go to the stairs. The stairs have a different 'moment of frequency' (they swing separately from the main part of the building). The stairs and remainder of the building continuously bump into each other until structural failure of the stairs takes place. The people who get on stairs before they fail are chopped up by the stair treads - horribly mutilated. Even if the building doesn't collapse, stay away from the stairs. The stairs are a likely part of the building to be damaged. Even if the stairs are not collapsed by the earthquake, they may collapse later
when overloaded by fleeing people. They should always be checked for safety, even when the rest of the building is not damaged.

8) Get near the outer walls of buildings or outside of them if possible - It is much better to be near the outside of the building rather than the interior. The farther inside you are from the outside perimeter of the building the greater the probability that your escape route will be blocked.

9) People inside of their vehicles are crushed when the road above falls in an earthquake and crushes their vehicles; which is exactly what happened with the slabs between the decks of the Nimitz Freeway. The victims of the San Francisco earthquake all stayed inside of their vehicles. They were all killed. They could have easily survived by getting out and sitting or lying next to their vehicles. Everyone killed would have survived if they had been able to get out of their cars and sit or lie next to them. All the crushed cars had voids 3 feet high next to them, except for the cars that had columns fall directly across them.

10) I discovered, while crawling inside of collapsed newspaper offices and other offices with a lot of paper, that paper does not compact. Large voids are found surrounding stacks of paper.

17/01/2016, 19:22 - Shubham Luhadia: And I found no option to do it manually.
17/01/2016, 19:23 - Shubham Luhadia: Contacted the customer care.
17/01/2016, 19:23 - Shubham Luhadia: Nothing doing.
17/01/2016, 19:23 - Vishal Keshav: Delete the google account from settings and again set the same account.
17/01/2016, 19:24 - Shubham Luhadia: Tried.
17/01/2016, 19:24 - Shubham Luhadia: Does not work.
17/01/2016, 19:25 - Vishal Keshav: Then only option is resseting / factory resetting your device if it the problem in your phone only.
17/01/2016, 19:26 - Shubham Luhadia: Hour can it be a problem with my phone?
17/01/2016, 19:26 - Vishal Keshav: That is a mystery.

20/01/2016, 09:05 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Why is WhatsApp extended to lifetime? Anyone has any idea?
20/01/2016, 09:09 - Vishal Keshav: News mein aaya tha ki kuch private companies are now funding whatsapp to use that in their bussiness. So whatsapp now need no money for non bussiness users.
20/01/2016, 09:09 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Oh... Big data
20/01/2016, 09:09 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Solution to almost everything
20/01/2016, 09:10 - Vishal Keshav: Maybe, this I am not sure of, how these companies will be using whatsapp for their bussiness
20/01/2016, 09:11 - Pranshu: Yeah! They are changing the revenue model, by introducing more services.
20/01/2016, 09:12 - Pranshu: Those services would be commercial and funded by other giants.
20/01/2016, 09:12 - Vishal Keshav: Can u elaborate on that,  whay wxactly is that.
20/01/2016, 09:12 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: NLP and big data, Ishant will have more idea about this things
20/01/2016, 09:12 - Pranshu: http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/18/whatsapp-free-business/#.twu5pna:9tJQ
20/01/2016, 09:12 - Vishal Keshav: No, revenue model
20/01/2016, 09:13 - Vishal Keshav: Ok
20/01/2016, 09:13 - Pranshu: NLP and big data? Ye sab mein kahaan chala gaya Romel abhi
20/01/2016, 09:13 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Revenue model us based in that...
20/01/2016, 09:13 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Yeh socho baaki company WhatsApp ko use kaise karega...

20/01/2016, 09:14 - Pranshu: It's not going to be just WhatsApp, rather other new projects
20/01/2016, 09:14 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Like?
20/01/2016, 09:15 - Pranshu: Article mein bhi likha hai ke abhi it's not finalised.
"They have not written a single line of code"
20/01/2016, 09:16 - Vishal Keshav: @romel Revenue comes first, then technology to aceive that like big data analytics.
20/01/2016, 09:17 - Vishal Keshav: But whithout finalizing, how am I receiving free lifetime membership
20/01/2016, 09:17 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Writing code is not their problem, its for the subscriber companies.. @vishal, whaaat?
20/01/2016, 09:18 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: If I'm a subscriber company, I would just take the data and process it on my own... WhatsApp need not write any code
20/01/2016, 09:18 - Vishal Keshav: I am sure that amazon is going to be one of the companies to have this pact with whatsapp
20/01/2016, 09:19 - Pranshu: NLP, big data kahaan se aaya beech mein.
It's simple that they are collaborating with other clients to develop new commercial services .
20/01/2016, 09:19 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Tab Pranshu hamara WhatsApp chat bhi dekhega... Kaise ab Amazon history dekhta hain

20/01/2016, 09:20 - Kanishk: Giving u free service will not mean they'll sell ur chat.
20/01/2016, 09:20 - Pranshu: Who said clients will use WhatsApp?
20/01/2016, 09:20 - Vishal Keshav: Sorry, sabka messege dekhlega pranshu
20/01/2016, 09:20 - Kanishk: Chutiya hai kya romel

20/01/2016, 15:53 - Vishal Keshav: Kuch kuch kar raha hoon.
20/01/2016, 19:09 - Shubham Luhadia: @Romel, using WhatsApp for so long, you would have noticed that WhatsApp is different from fb in the sense it does not hold your chat messages. They remain, as secure as your phone, on your phone. Or on the phone of the person on the other end of the conversation. So, they have no "data" to do any processing on. Further, if they share the information, it would be a grave privacy breach. So. All they have is a service platform with lots of users.
20/01/2016, 19:12 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Atlast... Somebody said a valid point. Good job flatmate
20/01/2016, 19:12 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: The question resurfaces again... How will they generate profit..
20/01/2016, 19:14 - Shubham Luhadia: Perhaps exposing the users to newer services at a cost? Like integrating Skype (just an example, don't explode over its feasibility!) If you pay a particular amount.
20/01/2016, 19:18 - Kanishk: BC bataya to
20/01/2016, 19:18 - Kanishk: They r gonna work with companies to set up intra messaging systrns
20/01/2016, 19:18 - Kanishk: And stuff like helping client customer interactions.
20/01/2016, 19:19 - Kanishk: Twitter is doing it with its direct messaging thing
20/01/2016, 19:19 - Kanishk: Ofcourse if they do something for company x they'll charge them
20/01/2016, 19:19 - Pranshu: Romel ko kuch padna hai nahi, time pass kar raha
20/01/2016, 19:22 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: At the end, atleast for now, the cost is zero.... How does this logic explain that, for all users?
20/01/2016, 19:22 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: @pranshu, kya padhna hain?
20/01/2016, 19:23 - Kanishk: Well they just had Facebook buy them
20/01/2016, 19:24 - Kanishk: So they got the money
20/01/2016, 19:24 - Kanishk: To maintain
20/01/2016, 19:24 - Kanishk: While they work on the other stuff
20/01/2016, 19:25 - Kanishk: And plus google ki best apps me hai
20/01/2016, 19:26 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Well yeah, that's actually an way to do for now..
20/01/2016, 19:26 - Kanishk: Top downloads geberated revenue
20/01/2016, 22:36 - Shubham Luhadia: But that can't be much, the top downloads generated revenue?
20/01/2016, 22:36 - Shubham Luhadia: Is it even Rs 1 per download?
20/01/2016, 22:37 - Kanishk: Yeah its ofc not much .and they do charge in us
20/01/2016, 22:37 - Kanishk: Us
20/01/2016, 22:37 - Kanishk: About a dollar a year
20/01/2016, 22:37 - Shubham Luhadia: Coz then also it works just have a billion. Less for a 19 billion app.
20/01/2016, 22:37 - Kanishk: Yeah
20/01/2016, 22:37 - Kanishk: But that's future ka dhyan me rakh ke
20/01/2016, 22:38 - Shubham Luhadia: Hmm... They either of course make some good decision. Or they could be like Google, whatever WhatsApp now attaches it's name with, will be considered trustable.
20/01/2016, 22:39 - Shubham Luhadia: *would

25/02/2016, 20:01 - Ishant Wankhede: Do think think umar khalid and other jnu students are insane?
25/02/2016, 20:04 - Kanishk: *brainwashed
25/02/2016, 20:13 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Go through what they said
25/02/2016, 20:14 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: It's a subaltern movement
25/02/2016, 20:14 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Rather, protest
25/02/2016, 20:14 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Those two statements do not match @shubham
25/02/2016, 20:15 - Vishal Keshav: What is happening here?
25/02/2016, 20:19 - Shubham Luhadia: Well, they do. It makes me miss hss. It makes me desire a debate on subaltern-ism. I, who was thoroughly convinced by rohini ma'am s views, on hearing smriti Irani, am doubtful now...
25/02/2016, 20:19 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Woow
25/02/2016, 20:20 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: So, people need not know what has happened? We should be state controlled minds.
25/02/2016, 20:21 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: And the worst part, her points were not even that strong, emotional mainly
25/02/2016, 20:21 - Shubham Luhadia: No, but we don't know what has happened. We think we go.

25/02/2016, 20:22 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: And she's no historian even..
25/02/2016, 20:22 - Vishal Keshav: Politicians will be like that only.
25/02/2016, 20:22 - Vishal Keshav: Try to convince audience with emotions without logic
25/02/2016, 20:23 - Vishal Keshav: But what is the point?
25/02/2016, 20:23 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: All rohini said in our last course was the history of India. It can be painted over quite easily it seems
25/02/2016, 20:23 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: @vishal, point of what?
25/02/2016, 20:24 - Vishal Keshav: Nothing.

06/03/2016, 03:03 - Vishal Keshav: Btw, story of max payne is traumatizing. It starts with a scene when max payne reaches his home finding his wife raped and murdered, his 9 month old child shot in the craddle itself. Now this man was left nothing to loose. His objective for life becomes destroying whole underworld of which murderers were a part of. And in the course of this, he meets many people and many events takes place which takes story to a new level. Thats why full and final version of max payne 3 was realesed in 2015 and story was closed.
06/03/2016, 03:03 - Vishal Keshav: Listen to this main theme of max payne to realize an anger, fear and revenge.

So, started sort of speed walking to another building from where the cab was available. I was walking very fast, silently.... There were two girls going at much slower pace. When I reached just behind, I whispered excuse me. One of the girls got so fucking scared, shouting oh my god in frightened pitch and almost sitting down in the middle of the road... She apologised sorry sorry sorry. Then I walked fast again to other building to find out that the other girl lives in same area as I do. In cab now..

16/03/2016, 22:46 - Ishant Wankhede: A monkey is sitting on a tree, smoking a  joint, when a lizard walks past. The lizard looks up and says “Hey! what are you doing?” The monkey says “Smoking a joint, come  up and join me"


 So the lizard climbs up  and sits next to the monkey and they have another joint. After a while  the lizard says his mouth is ‘dry’, and that he’s going to get a drink  from the river.

 At the riverbank,  the lizard is so stoned that he leans too far over and falls in. A  Crocodile sees this and swims over to the stoned lizard, helping him to  the side.

 He then asks the lizard, “What’s the matter with you?!”  The lizard explains to the crocodile that he was sitting on the tree,  smoking a joint with the monkey and  his  mouth got dry, and that he was so wasted that, when he went to get a  drink from the river, he fell in!

 The inquisitive crocodile says he  has to check this out. He walks into the jungle and finds the tree where  the monkey is sitting, finishing a joint. 

He looks up and says “Hey,  MONKEY!” 

The Monkey looks down and says “FUUUUUCK, DUDE……. Tu kitna pani piya re bhenchod??? 😂

20/03/2016, 17:16 - Vishal Keshav: 🤓
20/03/2016, 17:17 - Shubham Luhadia: His father owns some land in village.
20/03/2016, 17:18 - Shubham Luhadia: But they are kind of poor. They did not have enough money to pay for his fees, so not crores.
20/03/2016, 17:18 - Shubham Luhadia: The reliance job is obviously a huge deal, that's why.
20/03/2016, 17:18 - Vishal Keshav: So is this marraige about taking dowry?
20/03/2016, 17:18 - Shubham Luhadia: What??
20/03/2016, 17:19 - Shubham Luhadia: How do you get to that??
20/03/2016, 17:19 - Shubham Luhadia: He now earns more that other guys in his village.
20/03/2016, 17:19 - Vishal Keshav: Taking money to satisfy own needs in form of gift
20/03/2016, 17:19 - Shubham Luhadia: That's what this is about.
20/03/2016, 17:19 - Ishant Wankhede: Will he and his wife be able to sustain with the current ctc,  I meant to ask.
20/03/2016, 17:20 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: Yeah, given his background and marwardi connection, I would say dowry was involved...
20/03/2016, 17:20 - Vishal Keshav: Ok, i see. In village setting, maybe dowry is not a correct guess
20/03/2016, 17:20 - Shubham Luhadia: Yeah. Judging his life style, yes. They are pretty simple people. V
20/03/2016, 17:21 - Ishant Wankhede: Phir bhi its a responsibility he could have borne after some time.
20/03/2016, 17:22 - Vishal Keshav: Their parents will take care of her wife for the time being.
20/03/2016, 17:22 - Vishal Keshav: *his
20/03/2016, 17:22 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: I am sure parents have put some pressure. Beta shaadi kar le.. Next generation ka shakal dekhke marna hain dadi ko... Aisa

20/03/2016, 17:24 - Shubham Luhadia: No. In general that's the age. He is old actually. People generally get married around the time it's legal.

20/03/2016, 17:25 - 🐉 After all this time?? 🐉: 25 ho jayega uska umar august mein... It's sort of fair to get married... I would wait more 3-5 years, but I guess it's okay in rural India
20/03/2016, 17:25 - Vishal Keshav: I talked in college, i dont think so
20/03/2016, 17:25 - Shubham Luhadia: Gaanv mein aise Hi hota hai. And the money is enough. For them. Imagine, people who have never eaten a pastry, or a pizza. Gajanand hasn't.

20/03/2016, 17:29 - Ishant Wankhede: If putting myself in his position and deciding whether it's a apt for me to make the choice he made.. is judging.
20/03/2016, 17:29 - Shubham Luhadia: Judging: dahej ke liye kiya hoga, fake hoga, etc
20/03/2016, 17:30 - Shubham Luhadia: Ishant: thinking about affordability, no, that was not judging. My bad, I should have been clearer.
20/03/2016, 17:30 - Ishant Wankhede: Let us not think of him as village boy gajanand but iitian pass out working in a Metro gajanand.

(Pranshu, this was for people who are not totally photogenic in general)

23/03/2016, 21:05 - Ishant Wankhede: <Media omitted>
23/03/2016, 21:06 - Ishant Wankhede: Although on a lower and uncleanness data set.

23/03/2016, 21:10 - Ishant Wankhede: Okay vishal can you do this, get the text length of each person's each message. And now plot it, and do the hypothesis testing testing of the following two things, are Shubham messages longer or pranshu. And a gender wise hypothesis testing of who types more, let us take neha and romel as female for now.
23/03/2016, 21:11 - Shubham Luhadia: Pranshu sirf padhne aata hai. Aur phir daantra hai.
23/03/2016, 21:11 - Shubham Luhadia: Wow. Nice analysis idea, Ishant. 👍🏻

23/03/2016, 21:12 - Pavan K Panchasara: Still at bottom

23/03/2016, 21:13 - Shubham Luhadia: Pavan, you like to be on top?
23/03/2016, 21:13 - Pranshu: On a serious note, what is with the mentality of Indian women?

23/03/2016, 21:15 - Pranshu: Today when I was at a metro station, a guy pinched a girl.
Another guy, who was just in front, held him.
But that stupid girl, didn't say a word to that person, rather ignored the one who helped.
23/03/2016, 21:15 - Ishant Wankhede: I want someone to do a sentiment analysis of text messages person wise. Anybody working in nlp @shubham @romel?
23/03/2016, 21:15 - Neha Design: Pranshu bhouk bhi

23/03/2016, 21:16 - Vishal Keshav: He is a really good friend of mine
23/03/2016, 21:16 - Ishant Wankhede: Nahi rehne de i'll do it.
23/03/2016, 21:16 - Kanishk: Girls do it so do boys

23/03/2016, 21:17 - Shubham Luhadia: 😂😂
23/03/2016, 21:17 - Pranshu: Wtf
23/03/2016, 21:17 - Ishant Wankhede: I don't want to know how creep a person romel is, and how happy neha ans Shubham are.
23/03/2016, 21:17 - Kanishk: U dnt have to use analysis for that.
23/03/2016, 21:17 - Kanishk: Romel is a creep
23/03/2016, 21:17 - Kanishk: Neha is DUMB
23/03/2016, 21:18 - Shubham Luhadia: But on a serious note, Pranshu, I guess that girl just wanted all that attention to go away. Not everyone is a Geet: slap the person without thinking. Some people would rather dissolve away
23/03/2016, 21:18 - Kanishk: Geet kaun hai bc
23/03/2016, 21:18 - Kanishk: Geet gaata hu mai

23/03/2016, 21:18 - Kanishk: Maine hasne ka waada kiya tha kabhi
23/03/2016, 21:19 - Shubham Luhadia: Then she is mad.
23/03/2016, 21:19 - Kanishk: Maybe wo pasand karti hogi
23/03/2016, 21:19 - Shubham Luhadia: Or she liked being pinched? 😛
23/03/2016, 21:19 - Kanishk: Oh yea 😍
23/03/2016, 21:19 - Shubham Luhadia: (Same pinch Kanishk)
23/03/2016, 21:19 - Kanishk: Maybe am a masochist 😄
23/03/2016, 21:19 - Pranshu: Abe, he was a typical 'tapori'
23/03/2016, 21:20 - Shubham Luhadia: Ishant, sentiment analysis would tell you how happy one shows oneself to be. Not how happy they are.
23/03/2016, 21:20 - Pranshu: That girl was a 'behenji', if I am to use a stereotype
23/03/2016, 21:20 - Neha Design: So u saw one women behaving in a typical way and u generalised the entire gender
23/03/2016, 21:20 - Kanishk: *woman

23/03/2016, 21:20 - Shubham Luhadia: Video leta na! (Ya phone nahin khula? 😛)

23/03/2016, 21:22 - Kanishk: 😂😂
23/03/2016, 21:24 - Neha Design: Yeah btw kanishk when you were generalising my msgs, did u consider that when i m in loop i m either dumb or mad in end with mention of manan
23/03/2016, 21:24 - Pranshu: Indian women- as you might be knowing doesn't only comprise of the educated, and  sophisticated ones like you
23/03/2016, 21:24 - Shubham Luhadia: Pavan, sab zinda hain tu hai kahaan?

23/03/2016, 21:25 - Kanishk: Ooo oo oo
23/03/2016, 21:25 - Pranshu: I was referring to the somewhat Orthodox or archaic believes of being from an oppressed gender
23/03/2016, 21:25 - Shubham Luhadia: Kanishk nahaya hi nahin.
23/03/2016, 21:25 - Pranshu: And not taking action against it
23/03/2016, 21:25 - Kanishk: Oh stfu
